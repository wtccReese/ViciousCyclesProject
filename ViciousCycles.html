            <h1> Vicious Cycles </h1>
            <p>Here at Vicious Cycles, we make it our goal to find the perfect setup
                for you. Do you want to speed down the streets or would you prefer treking
                up the mountains? Give us an idea of what you dream of and we'll make it a reality.
               
                Vicious Cycles is a local store for bikers. These can be casual bikes, mountain bikes, 
                high-performance tricked-out BMX bikes, etc. Alternately, these can be Harley Davidson, 
                an American Eagle, mopeds, scooters, Kawasaki’s, or even concept vehicles. The choice of item is up to you. 
                What brands do you want to sell? Or be a dealer for? Vicious also sells accessories.
    
                 We cater to clients who want our bikes. Most are passionate about biking and see it as part of a lifestyle. 
                 This might mean they are competitive, like to style their vehicles, incorporate biking into their daily lives for transportation,
                 or may just be a weekend warrior. Many members visit the site to place orders and to see the new stock. Our customers know bikes 
                 so they don't need large detailed descriptions about each product but they might be interested in the specs. They just need to see the name, 
                 price, and image of the product. We are a business-to-customer organization (B2C). Requirements We want a site where customers can explore new bikes 
                 and add-ons that inspire and excite them. We want the world to see how fantastic these machines are. The bikes are the main attraction of this website 
                 and everything should be designed around that. The website should convey style, quality, power/speed, and freedom.
            
                 We don’t just customize bikes. We also sell stuff we know you’ll dig. Riding is a lifestyle, and we want to help you live your life. You pick the brand(s) 
                 that Vicious carries.  
                 
                 When it comes to industry-leading innovations in cycles and accessories, Vicious Cycle products are what you have been waiting for. We sell top-quality cycling 
                 equipment and have been doing it for years. Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have been copying us for some time. Don't be fooled
                 by imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for second best when it comes to your cycling needs, but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious Cycle Products
                 is a name you can put your trust in, at a price you can afford. Of course, custom work is another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested in a "Race to the Bottom" when 
                 it comes to creating custom builds. If you're interested in discussing a fully custom or customized build,
                 come down to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do.
                 
                 Vicious Cycles Inc is a (your town)-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attend 
                 to the day-to-day operations. We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.
                 We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism. We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
                 You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again. It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.
                 
                 At Vicious Cycles, we are committed to providing superior customer service and satisfaction. Our staff will assist you every step of the way, from product selection and ordering to truly custom builds. We’ve been doing this whole custom thing for quite a while, 
                 and we've seen some ups and downs, we're loving every moment of it. A proper custom build takes time, and we’ll work closely with you to get it right. From stylish cycles to trusty monster rides, we’ve done them all. Talk with a 
                 member of our mechanic's team to discuss your plan, and we'll see your dream realized.
    
                 Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an existing bike with cash, credit, or in-house loan approval.
                 All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan, or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are final.
    
                 We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  We are at home in the indoor showroom, but we believe the real showroom can only be found out on and off the road. Cycling is a lifestyle- Live Your Life </p>
